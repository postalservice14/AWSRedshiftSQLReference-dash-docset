                        indicate whether each user is known to like different types of events, such as sports,
                        theatre, opera, and so on. For example:

                        single integer column that defines (in binary form) eight types of events that each
                        user
                        likes or dislikes. In this design, each bit position represents a type of event, and
                        a
                        user who likes all eight types has all eight bits set to 1 (as in the first row of
                        the
                        following table). A user who does not like any of these events has all eight bits
                        set to
                        0 (see second row). A user who likes only sports and jazz is represented in the third
