    <div></div><h1 class="topictitle" id="r_LOCK">LOCK</h1><p>Restricts access to a database table. This command is only meaningful when it is run
                        inside a transaction block.
                     </p><p>The LOCK command obtains a table-level lock in &quot;ACCESS EXCLUSIVE&quot; mode, waiting if
                        necessary for any conflicting locks to be released. Explicitly locking a table in
                        this way
                        causes reads and writes on the table to wait when they are attempted from other
                        transactions or sessions. An explicit table lock created by one user temporarily prevents
                        another user from selecting data from that table or loading data into it. The lock
                        is
                        released when the transaction that contains the LOCK command completes.
                     </p><p>Less restrictive table locks are acquired implicitly by commands that refer to tables,
                        such as write operations. For example, if a user tries to read data from a table while
                        another user is updating the table, the data that is read will be a snapshot of the
                        data
                        that has already been committed. (In some cases, queries will abort if they violate
                        serializable isolation rules.) See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_Concurrent_writes.html">Managing Concurrent Write Operations</a>.
                     </p><p>Some DDL operations, such as DROP TABLE and TRUNCATE, create exclusive locks. These
                        operations prevent data reads.
                     </p><p>If a lock conflict occurs, Amazon Redshift displays an error message to alert the
                        user who
                        started the transaction in conflict. The transaction that received the lock conflict
                        is
                        aborted. Every time a lock conflict occurs, Amazon Redshift writes an entry to the
                        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_STL_TR_CONFLICT.html">STL_TR_CONFLICT</a> table.
