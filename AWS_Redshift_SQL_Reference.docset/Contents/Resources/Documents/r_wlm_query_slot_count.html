                        <b>1</b>, 1 to 50 (cannot exceed number of available slots

                        concurrency level set for the queue (for example, if concurrency level is set to 5,
                        then
                        the service class has 5 slots). WLM allocates the available memory for a service class
                        equally to each slot. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/cm-c-implementing-workload-management.html">Implementing Workload
                           Management</a>.

                        <p class="aws-note">Note</p>
                        <p>If the value of wlm_query_slot_count is larger than the number of available slots
                           (concurrency level) for the service class, the query fails. If you encounter an
                           error, decrease wlm_query_slot_count to an allowable value.
                        </p>
                     </div><p> For operations where performance is heavily affected by the amount of memory
                        allocated, such as Vacuum, increasing the value of wlm_query_slot_count can improve
                        performance. In particular, for slow Vacuum commands, inspect the corresponding record
                        in the SVV_VACUUM_SUMMARY view. If you see high values (close to or higher than 100)
                        for
                        sort_partitions and merge_increments in the SVV_VACUUM_SUMMARY view, consider increasing
                        the value for wlm_query_slot_count the next time you run Vacuum against that
                        table.
                     </p><p>Increasing the value of wlm_query_slot_count limits the number of concurrent queries
                        that can be run. For example, suppose the service class has a concurrency level of
                        5 and
                        wlm_query_slot_count is set to 3. While a query is running within the session with
                        wlm_query_slot_count set to 3, a maximum of 2 more concurrent queries can be executed
                        within the same service class. Subsequent queries wait in the queue until currently
                        executing queries complete and slots are freed.
                     </p><h2 id="r_wlm_query_slot_count-examples">Examples</h2><p>Use the SET command to set the value of wlm_query_slot_count for the duration of the
                        current session.
