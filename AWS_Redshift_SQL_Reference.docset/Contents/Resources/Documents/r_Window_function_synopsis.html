                              <p>Clause that defines the window specification. The OVER clause is
                                 mandatory for window functions and differentiates window functions from
                                 other SQL functions. 
                              </p>

                              <p>Optional. The PARTITION BY clause subdivides the result set into
                                 partitions, much like the GROUP BY clause. If a partition clause is present,
                                 the function is calculated for the rows in each partition. If no partition
                                 clause is specified, a single partition contains the entire table, and the
                                 function is computed for that complete table. 
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>The ranking functions, DENSE_RANK, NTILE, RANK, and ROW_NUMBER, require a
                                 global comparison of all the rows in the result set. When a PARTITION BY
                                 clause is used, the query optimizer can execute each aggregation in parallel
                                 by spreading the workload across multiple slices according to the
                                 partitions. If the PARTITION BY clause is not present, the aggregation step
                                 must be executed serially on a single slice, which can have a significant
                                 negative impact on performance, especially for large clusters.
                              </p>
                              
                           </dd>
                           
                           
                           <dt><span class="term">ORDER BY <em>order_list</em>
                                 </span></dt>
                           
                           <dd>
                              
                              <p>Optional. The window function is applied to the rows within each
                                 partition sorted according to the order specification in ORDER BY. This
                                 ORDER BY clause is distinct from and completely unrelated to an ORDER BY
                                 clause in a nonwindow function (outside of the OVER clause). The ORDER BY
                                 clause can be used without the PARTITION BY clause. 
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>For the ranking functions, the ORDER BY clause identifies the measures
                                 for the ranking values. For aggregation functions, the partitioned rows must
                                 be ordered before the aggregate function is computed for each frame. For
                                 more about window function types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_Window_functions.html">Window Functions</a>.

                              <p>Column identifiers or expressions that evaluate to column identifiers are
                                 required in the order list. Neither constants nor constant expressions can
                                 be used as substitutes for column names.

                              <p>NULLS values are treated as their own group, sorted and ranked according
                                 to the NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST option. By default, NULL values are sorted
                                 and ranked last in ASC ordering, and sorted and ranked first in DESC
                                 ordering.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p> If the ORDER BY clause is omitted, the order of the rows is
                                 nondeterministic. 
                              </p>

                                 <p>In any parallel system such as Amazon Redshift, when an ORDER BY clause does
                                    not produce a unique and total ordering of the data, the order of the
                                    rows is nondeterministic. That is, if the ORDER BY expression produces
                                    duplicate values (a partial ordering), the return order of those rows
                                    might vary from one run of Amazon Redshift to the next. In turn, window
                                    functions might return unexpected or inconsistent results. For more

                              <p>This clause defines the window frame by specifying a
                                 physical offset from the current
                                 row.

                              <p>This clause specifies the rows in the current window or partition that
                                 the value in the current row is to be combined with. It uses arguments that
                                 specify row position, which can be before or after the current row. The
                                 reference point for all window frames is the current row. Each row becomes
                                 the current row in turn as the window frame slides forward in the
                                 partition.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>The frame can be a simple set of rows up to and including the current
                                 row:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"></div><div class="btn-dark-theme" title="Dark theme" title-dark="Dark theme" title-light="Light theme"></div></div><code class="nohighlight">{UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | <em>offset</em> PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW}</code></pre>
                              <p> or it can be a set of rows between two boundaries: </p>

                              <p>UNBOUNDED PRECEDING indicates that the window starts at the first row of
                                 the partition; <em>offset</em> PRECEDING indicates that the
                                 window starts a number of rows equivalent to the value of offset before the
                                 current row. UNBOUNDED PRECEDING is the default.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>CURRENT ROW indicates the window begins or ends at the current row. </p>
                              
                              <p>UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING indicates that the window ends at the last row of the
                                 partition; <em>offset</em> FOLLOWING indicates that the window
                                 ends a number of rows equivalent to the value of offset after the current
                                 row.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p><em>offset</em> identifies a physical
                                 number of rows before or after the current row. In this case,
                                 <em>offset</em> must be a constant that evaluates to a
                                 positive numeric value. For example, 5 FOLLOWING will end the frame 5 rows
                                 after the current row.
                              </p>
                              
                              
                              <p>Where BETWEEN is not specified, the frame is implicitly bounded by the
                                 current row. For example <code class="code">ROWS 5 PRECEDING</code> is equal to
                                 <code class="code">ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW</code>, and <code class="code">ROWS
                                    UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</code> is equal to <code class="code">ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND
                                    UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</code>.
                              </p>
