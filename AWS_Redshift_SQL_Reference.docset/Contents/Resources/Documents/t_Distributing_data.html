                     </div><p>When you load data into a table, Amazon Redshift distributes the rows of the table
                        to each of
                        the compute nodes according to the table&apos;s distribution style. When you run a query,
                        the
                        query optimizer redistributes the rows to the compute nodes as needed to perform any
                        joins and aggregations. The goal in selecting a table distribution style is to minimize
                        the impact of the redistribution step by locating the data where it needs to be before
                        the query is executed.
                     </p><p>This section will introduce you to the principles of data distribution in an Amazon
                        Redshift
                        database and give you a methodology to choose the best distribution style for each
                        of
                        your tables.

                        <b>Nodes and slices</b>
                        
                     </p><p> An Amazon Redshift cluster is a set of nodes. Each node in the cluster has its own
                        operating system, dedicated memory, and dedicated disk storage. One node is the
                        <em>leader node</em>, which manages the distribution of data and
                        query processing tasks to the <em>compute nodes</em>. 
                     </p><p> The disk storage for a compute node is divided into a number of
                        <em>slices</em>. The number of slices per node depends on the node
                        size of the cluster. For example, each DS1.XL compute node has two slices, and each
                        DS1.8XL compute node has 16 slices. The nodes all participate in parallel query
                        execution, working on data that is distributed as evenly as possible across the
                        slices. For more information about the number of slices that each node size has, go
                        to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html#rs-about-clusters-and-nodes">About Clusters and Nodes</a> in the
                        <em>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</em>.

                        <b>Data redistribution</b>
                        
                     </p><p> When you load data into a table, Amazon Redshift distributes the rows of the table
                        to
                        each of the node slices according to the table&apos;s distribution style. As part of a
                        query plan, the optimizer determines where blocks of data need to be located to best
                        execute the query. The data is then physically moved, or redistributed, during
                        execution. Redistribution might involve either sending specific rows to nodes for
                        joining or broadcasting an entire table to all of the nodes. 
                     </p><p> Data redistribution can account for a substantial portion of the cost of a query
                        plan, and the network traffic it generates can affect other database operations and
                        slow overall system performance. To the extent that you anticipate where best to
                        locate data initially, you can minimize the impact of data redistribution. 
                     </p><p>
                        <b>Data distribution goals</b>
                        
                     </p><p> When you load data into a table, Amazon Redshift distributes the table&apos;s rows to
                        the
                        compute nodes and slices according to the distribution style that you chose when you
                        created the table. Data distribution has two primary goals: 
                     </p><div class="itemizedlist">
                        
                        
                        
                        <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
                           <li class="listitem">
                              
                              <p>To distribute the workload uniformly among the nodes in the cluster.
                                 Uneven distribution, or data distribution skew, forces some nodes to do more
                                 work than others, which impairs query performance.
                              </p>
                              
                           </li>
                           <li class="listitem">
                              
                              <p>To minimize data movement during query execution. If the rows that
                                 participate in joins or aggregates are already collocated on the nodes with
                                 their joining rows in other tables, the optimizer does not need to
                                 redistribute as much data during query execution.
                              </p>
                              
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </div><p>The distribution strategy that you choose for your database has important
                        consequences for query performance, storage requirements, data loading, and
                        maintenance. By choosing the best distribution style for each table, you can balance
                        your data distribution and significantly improve overall system performance.
