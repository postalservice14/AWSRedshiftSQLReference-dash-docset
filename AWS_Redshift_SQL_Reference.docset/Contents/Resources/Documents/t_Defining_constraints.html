                        <em>they are not enforced by Amazon Redshift</em>. Nonetheless, primary keys
                        and foreign keys are used as planning hints and they should be declared if your ETL
                        process or some other process in your application enforces their integrity.
                     </p><p>For example, the query planner uses primary and foreign keys in certain statistical
                        computations, to infer uniqueness and referential relationships that affect subquery
                        decorrelation techniques, to order large numbers of joins, and to eliminate redundant
                        joins.
                     </p><p>The planner leverages these key relationships, but it assumes that all keys in
                        Amazon Redshift tables are valid as loaded. If your application allows invalid foreign
                        keys or
                        primary keys, some queries could return incorrect results. For example, a SELECT
                        DISTINCT query might return duplicate rows if the primary key is not unique. Do not
                        define key constraints for your tables if you doubt their validity. On the other hand,
                        you should always declare primary and foreign keys and uniqueness constraints when
                        you
                        know that they are valid.
                     </p><p>Amazon Redshift <em>does</em> enforce NOT NULL column constraints.
