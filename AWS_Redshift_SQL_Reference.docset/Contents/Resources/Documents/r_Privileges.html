    <div></div><h1 class="topictitle" id="r_Privileges">Default Database User Privileges</h1><p>When you create a database object, you are its owner. By default, only a superuser
                        or
                        the owner of an object can query, modify, or grant privileges on the object. For users
                        to
                        use an object, you must grant the necessary privileges to the user or the group that
                        contains the user. Database superusers have the same privileges as database owners.
                     </p><p>Amazon Redshift supports the following privileges: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE,
                        REFERENCES,
                        CREATE, TEMPORARY, and USAGE. Different privileges are associated with different object
                        types. For information on database object privileges supported by Amazon Redshift,
                        see the <a href="r_GRANT.html">GRANT</a> command.
                     </p><p>The right to modify or destroy an object is always the privilege of the owner only.
                        
                     </p><p>To revoke a privilege that was previously granted, use the <a href="r_REVOKE.html">REVOKE</a> command. The privileges of the object owner, such as DROP,
                        GRANT, and REVOKE privileges, are implicit and cannot be granted or revoked. Object
                        owners
                        can revoke their own ordinary privileges, for example, to make a table read-only for
                        themselves as well as others. Superusers retain all privileges regardless of GRANT
                        and
                        REVOKE commands.
