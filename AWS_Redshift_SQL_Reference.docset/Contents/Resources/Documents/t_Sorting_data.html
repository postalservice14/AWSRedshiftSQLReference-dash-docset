    <div></div><h1 class="topictitle" id="t_Sorting_data">Choosing Sort Keys</h1><p>When you create a table, you can define one or more of its columns as <em>sort
                           keys</em>. When data is initially loaded into the empty table, the rows are
                        stored on disk in sorted order. Information about sort key columns is passed to the
                        query planner, and the planner uses this information to construct plans that exploit
                        the
                        way that the data is sorted. 
                     </p><p>Sorting enables efficient handling of range-restricted predicates. Amazon Redshift
                        stores
                        columnar data in 1 MB disk blocks. The min and max values for each block are stored
                        as
                        part of the metadata. If query uses a range-restricted predicate, the query processor
                        can use the min and max values to rapidly skip over large numbers of blocks during
                        table
                        scans. For example, if a table stores five years of data sorted by date and a query
                        specifies a date range of one month, up to 98 percent of the disk blocks can be
                        eliminated from the scan. If the data is not sorted, more of the disk blocks (possibly
                        all of them) have to be scanned. 
                     </p><p>You can specify either a compound or interleaved sort key. A compound sort key is
                        more
                        efficient when query predicates use a <em>prefix</em>, which
                        is a subset of the sort key columns in order. An interleaved sort key gives equal
                        weight
                        to each column in the sort key, so query predicates can use any subset of the columns
                        that make up the sort key, in any order. For examples of using compound sort keys
                        and
                        interleaved sort keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Sorting_data-compare-sort-styles.html">Comparing Sort Styles</a>.
                     </p><p>To understand the impact of the chosen sort key on query performance, use the <a href="r_EXPLAIN.html">EXPLAIN</a> command. For more information, see
                        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c-query-planning.html">Query Planning and Execution Workflow</a>
                        
                     </p><p>To define a sort type, use either the INTERLEAVED or COMPOUND keyword with your CREATE
                        TABLE or CREATE TABLE AS statement. The default is COMPOUND. An INTERLEAVED sort key
                        can
                        use a maximum of eight columns.

                     </div><h2 id="t_Sorting_data-compound">Compound Sort Key</h2><p> A compound key is made up of all of the columns listed in the sort key
                        definition, in the order they are listed. A compound sort key is most useful when
                        a
                        query&apos;s filter applies conditions, such as filters and joins, that use a prefix of
                        the sort keys. The performance benefits of compound sorting decrease when queries
                        depend only on secondary sort columns, without referencing the primary columns.
                        COMPOUND is the default sort type.
                     </p><p>Compound sort keys might speed up joins, GROUP BY and ORDER BY operations, and
                        window functions that use PARTITION BY and ORDER BY. For example, a merge join,
                        which is often faster than a hash join, is feasible when the data is distributed and
                        presorted on the joining columns. Compound sort keys also help improve compression.
                        
                     </p><p>As you add rows to a sorted table that already contains data, the unsorted region
                        grows, which has a significant effect on performance. The effect is greater when the
                        table uses interleaved sorting, especially when the sort columns include data that
                        increases monotonically, such as date or timestamp columns. You should run a VACUUM
                        operation regularly, especially after large data loads, to re-sort and re-analyze
                        the data. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_vacuum_diskspacereqs.html">Managing the Size of the Unsorted
                           Region</a>. After vacuuming to resort the data,
                        it&apos;s a good practice to run an ANALYZE command to update the statistical metadata
                        for the query planner. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Analyzing_tables.html">Analyzing Tables</a>.
                     </p><h2 id="t_Sorting_data-interleaved">Interleaved Sort Key</h2><p>An interleaved sort gives equal weight to each column, or subset of columns, in
                        the sort key. If multiple queries use different columns for filters, then you can
                        often improve performance for those queries by using an interleaved sort style. When
                        a query uses restrictive predicates on secondary sort columns, interleaved sorting
                        significantly improves query performance as compared to compound sorting.

                        <p class="aws-note">Important</p>
                        <p>Don&#x2019;t use an interleaved sort key on columns with monotonically increasing
                           attributes, such as identity columns, dates, or timestamps.
                        </p>
                     </div><p>The performance improvements you gain by implementing an interleaved sort key
                        should be weighed against increased load and vacuum times. 
                     </p><p>Interleaved sorts are most effective with highly selective queries that filter on
                        one or more of the sort key columns in the WHERE clause, for example <code class="code">select
                           c_name from customer where c_region = &apos;ASIA&apos;</code>. The benefits of interleaved
                        sorting increase with the number of sorted columns that are restricted. 
                     </p><p>An interleaved sort is more effective with large tables. Sorting is applied on
                        each slice, so an interleaved sort is most effective when a table is large enough
                        to
                        require multiple 1 MB blocks per slice and the query processor is able to skip a
                        significant proportion of the blocks using restrictive predicates. To view the
                        number of blocks a table uses, query the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_STV_BLOCKLIST.html">STV_BLOCKLIST</a> system view.
                     </p><p> When sorting on a single column, an interleaved sort might give better
                        performance than a compound sort if the column values have a long common prefix. For
                        example, URLs commonly begin with &quot;http://www&quot;. Compound sort keys use a limited
                        number of characters from the prefix, which results in a lot of duplication of keys.
                        Interleaved sorts use an internal compression scheme for zone map values that
                        enables them to better discriminate among column values that have a long common
                        prefix.
                     </p><p class="title"><b>VACUUM REINDEX</b></p><p>As you add rows to a sorted table that already contains data, performance
                        might deteriorate over time. This deterioration occurs for both compound and
                        interleaved sorts, but it has a greater effect on interleaved tables. A VACUUM
                        restores the sort order, but the operation can take longer for interleaved
                        tables because merging new interleaved data might involve modifying every data
                        block.
                     </p><p>When tables are initially loaded, Amazon Redshift analyzes the distribution of the
                        values
                        in the sort key columns and uses that information for optimal interleaving of the
                        sort key columns. As a table grows, the distribution of the values in the sort key
                        columns can change, or skew, especially with date or timestamp columns. If the skew
                        becomes too large, performance might be affected. To re-analyze the sort keys and
                        restore performance, run the VACUUM command with the REINDEX key word. Because it
                        needs to take an extra analysis pass over the data, VACUUM REINDEX can take longer
                        than a standard VACUUM for interleaved tables. To view information about key
                        distribution skew and last reindex time, query the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SVV_INTERLEAVED_COLUMNS.html">SVV_INTERLEAVED_COLUMNS</a>
