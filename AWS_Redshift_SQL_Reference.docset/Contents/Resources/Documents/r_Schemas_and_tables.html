    <div></div><h1 class="topictitle" id="r_Schemas_and_tables">Schemas</h1><p>A database contains one or more named schemas. Each schema in a database contains
                        tables
                        and other kinds of named objects. By default, a database has a single schema, which
                        is
                        named PUBLIC. You can use schemas to group database objects under a common name. Schemas
                        are similar to operating system directories, except that schemas cannot be nested.
                     </p><p>Identical database object names can be used in different schemas in the same database
                        without conflict. For example, both MY_SCHEMA and YOUR_SCHEMA can contain a table
                        named
                        MYTABLE. Users with the necessary privileges can access objects across multiple schemas
                        in
                        a database.
                     </p><p>By default, an object is created within the first schema in the search path of the
                        database. For information, see <a href="r_Schemas_and_tables.html#c_Search_path">Search Path</a> later in this section.
                     </p><p>Schemas can help with organization and concurrency issues in a multi-user environment
                        in
                        the following ways:
