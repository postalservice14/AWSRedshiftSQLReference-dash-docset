                        <p>Only the table owner or a superuser can effectively vacuum a table. If VACUUM is run
                           without the necessary table privileges, the operation completes successfully but has
                           no
                           effect. 
                        </p>
                     </div><p>By default, VACUUM skips the sort phase for any table where more than 95 percent of
                        the
                        table&apos;s rows are already sorted. Skipping the sort phase can significantly improve
                        VACUUM
                        performance. To change the default sort or delete threshold for a single table, include
                        the
                        table name and the TO <em>threshold</em> PERCENT parameter when you run VACUUM. 
                     </p><p>Users can access tables while they are being vacuumed. You can perform queries and
                        write
                        operations while a table is being vacuumed, but when data manipulation language (DML)
                        commands and a vacuum run concurrently, both might take longer. If you execute UPDATE
                        and
                        DELETE statements during a vacuum, system performance might be reduced. VACUUM DELETE
                        temporarily blocks update and delete operations.

                        vacuum
                        operation pauses when users run data definition language (DDL) operations, such as
                        ALTER

                        <p>The Amazon Redshift VACUUM command syntax and behavior are substantially different
                           from the
                           PostgreSQL VACUUM operation. For example, the default VACUUM operation in Amazon Redshift
                           is
                           VACUUM FULL, which reclaims disk space and resorts all rows. In contrast, the default
                           VACUUM operation in PostgreSQL simply reclaims space and makes it available for
                           reuse.

                                 disk space is not important but resorting new rows is important. A SORT ONLY
                                 vacuum reduces the elapsed time for vacuum operations when the unsorted region
                                 doesn&apos;t contain a large number of deleted rows and doesn&apos;t span the entire
                                 sorted region. Applications that don&apos;t have disk space constraints but do
                                 depend on query optimizations associated with keeping table rows sorted can
                                 benefit from this kind of vacuum.

                                 free up the consumed space. A DELETE ONLY vacuum operation doesn&apos;t sort table

                                 can also be useful when your query performance is already optimal, and
                                 resorting rows to optimize query performance is not a requirement.

                                 operation can take longer for interleaved tables because the interleaved sort
                                 might need to rearrange more rows than a compound sort.

                                 table is less than the sort threshold, Amazon Redshift can often reduce VACUUM times
                                 significantly. Similarly, when VACUUM is not constrained to reclaim space from
                                 100 percent of rows marked for deletion, it is often able to skip rewriting
                                 blocks that contain only a few deleted rows.

                              <p>For example, if you specify 75 for <em>threshold</em>, VACUUM
                                 skips the sort phase if 75 percent or more of the table&apos;s rows are already in
                                 sort order. For the delete phase, VACUUMS sets a target of reclaiming disk
                                 space such that at least 75 percent of the table&apos;s rows are not marked for
                                 deletion following the vacuum. The <em>threshold</em> value must be
                                 an integer between 0 and 100. The default is 95. If you specify a value of 100,
                                 VACUUM always sorts the table unless it&apos;s already fully sorted and reclaims
                                 space from all rows marked for deletion. If you specify a value of 0, VACUUM
                                 never sorts the table and never reclaims space.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>If you include the TO <em>threshold</em> PERCENT parameter, you
                                 must also specify a table name. If a table name is omitted, VACUUM fails.

                                 operation; in this case, a second vacuum operation will be necessary.

                                 tables in order to start. This exclusive access is required briefly, so vacuum
                                 operations don&apos;t block concurrent loads and inserts for any significant period of
                                 time.

                              <p>A DELETE ONLY vacuum operation on a small table might not reduce the number of
                                 blocks used to store the data, especially when the table has a large number of
                                 columns or the cluster uses a large number of slices per node. These vacuum
                                 operations add one block per column per slice to account for concurrent inserts
                                 into the table, and there is potential for this overhead to outweigh the reduction
                                 in block count from the reclaimed disk space. For example, if a 10-column table on
                                 an 8-node cluster occupies 1000 blocks before a vacuum, the vacuum does not reduce
                                 the actual block count unless more than 80 blocks of disk space are reclaimed
                                 because of deleted rows. (Each data block uses 1 MB.)
